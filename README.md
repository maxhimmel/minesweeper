## :pencil: Description
Minesweeper is a logic puzzle video game genre generally played on personal computers. The game features a grid of clickable tiles, with hidden "mines" scattered throughout the board. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. 

My first exposure to Minesweeper was on my mom's Windows '95 machine. I never knew what I was doing, but I enjoyed clicking the cells randomly and watching the board flood. It wasn't until some time after college that I learned to play the game properly.

**Be careful.** It gets addicting.
